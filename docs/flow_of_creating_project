# within project_router.py file the @router.post("/create/") endpoint is called with 3 fields within the json:


{
    "name": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "user_id": "string"
}


First we will check if the user_id exists within the user node and then create the project with the above attributes:

- Get the shortID
- post the shortID and the userID to the user_projects sql table


Next goal: Get Project Tree data

- Build two post endpoint that takes a user_id and project_short_id and returns the project tree data
        Endpoint NR1: For the front-end to read
        Endpoint NR2: And for the AI to read
- Organize the tree in such a way that it can be easily rendered in the frontend

Or shall we make the front-end organize everything for the AI to read the text?



Add task to project

- Check the functions again that add a task to a project,
we prefer that the user_id and project_shor_id's are passed so the search will be optimized
